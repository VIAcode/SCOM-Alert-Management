## Overview

The SCOM Alert Management solution extends capabilities of Microsoft Alert Management solution with automation of alert rules creation for System Center Operations Manager management group connected to the Log Analytics workspace. The solution creates an alert rule for each SCOM alert type. After Alert rule is available on Azure Monitor, you can manage them as standard scheduled query rules. At the same time, the solution closes SCOM Alerts generated by standard Alert Management solution. Key Scenarios, not available in the Microsoft Alert Management solution:

- Automatically create Azure Alert Rules for all SCOM alerts.
- Propagate SCOM Alert description into Azure Alert events.
- Support enabling and disabling of Azure Alert generation for corresponding SCOM Alerts.
- Support integration scenarios, such as webhooks, action groups, etc.


## Prerequisites

Note: When you install SCOM Alert Management solution it automatically closes all alerts generated by AlertManagement.

Before starting, review the following requirements.

- Download and set up System Center Operation Manager from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/manage-operations-guide-overview?view=sc-om-1807).
- Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace).
- Connect Operations Manager to Azure Monitor from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/om-agents).
- Add the Alert Management solution to your Log Analytics workspace. Instruction is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alert-management-solution).
- Connect Azure to ITSM tools using IT Service Management Connector [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/itsmc-overview)

### Case study

Let's consider the following case when an error has occurred on the client's side.

The error on the client side:

![Testdb offline](./media/testdb_offline.jpg)

The alert in SCOM:

![SCOM alert](./media/SCOM2016RTMs_alert.jpg)

1. In the portal, select **Monitor** and under the Monitor section - choose **Alerts**.

![Monitor Alerts](./media/monitor_alerts.jpg)

2. You will land on the Alerts Summary page, which gives you an overview of all your alert instances across Azure.

![Alert Management solution](./media/all_alerts.jpg)

As you can see, the alert raised in Azure does not have a correspondent alert rule, so you cannot manage this alert - you cannot disable it, change severity, assign an action group.

### Create ITSM work items from Azure alerts

When creating/editing an Azure alert rule, use an Action group, which has an ITSM Action. When the alert triggers, work item is created/updated in the ITSM tool.

Once you have your ITSM connection created, you can create work item(s) in your ITSM tool based on Azure alerts, by using the ITSM Action in Action Groups.

Use the following procedure:

1. In Azure portal, click **Monitor**.
2. Click **Alerts**
3. In the command bar on the top, click **Manage actions**.
4. Click on **Add action group**.
5. Provide **Name** and **ShortName** for your action group. Select the **Resource Group** and **Subscription** where you want to create your action group.
