# SCOM Alert Management solution

## Overview

The SCOM Alert Management solution extends capabilities of Microsoft Alert Management solution with automation of alert rules creation for System Center Operations Manager management group connected to the Log Analytics workspace. The solution creates an alert rule for each SCOM alert type. After Alert rule is available on Azure Monitor, you can manage them as standard scheduled query rules. At the same time, the solution closes SCOM Alerts generated by standard Alert Management solution. Key Scenarios, not available in the Microsoft Alert Management solution:

- Automatically create Azure Alert Rules for all SCOM alerts.
- Propagate SCOM Alert description into Azure Alert events.
- Support enabling and disabling of Azure Alert generation for corresponding SCOM Alerts.
- Support integration scenarios, such as webhooks, action groups, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, review the following requirements.

- Download and set up System Center Operation Manager from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/manage-operations-guide-overview?view=sc-om-1807).
- Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace).
- Connect Operations Manager to Azure Monitor from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/om-agents).
- Add the Alert Management solution to your Log Analytics workspace.

Let's consider the following case when an error has occurred on the client's side.

The error on the client side:

The alert in SCOM:

1. In the portal, select **Monitor** and under the Monitor section - choose **Alerts**.

![Monitor Alerts](./media/monitor_alerts.jpg)

2. You will land on the Alerts Summary page, which gives you an overview of all your alert instances across Azure.

As you can see, the alert raised in Azure does not have a correspondent alert rule, so you cannot manage this alerts - you cannot disable them, change severity, assign an action group.
